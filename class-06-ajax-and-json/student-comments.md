## WHICH ASPECTS OF THE COURSE DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- None in particular.

- I didn't really find anything that wasn't helpful this week. Lecture and lab both went well for me.

- This course is a bit harder than anything else I've done before.

- Most of the lectures were either too shallow or were glossed over too fast. I would rather have the instructor code more and me follow along while he explains the concepts.

- Some of the lectures beat the dead horse to a pulp. It would be nice to have less of that and more time to practice coding.

- The reading from the Duckett book was not as helpful, although there were a few pages that would be good to reference later on.

- Readings. Material presented in class is much easier to digest and it is more relevant to the lab assignments.

- Looking for more individual assignments.

- Pair programming is a big time sink and depending on your partner can be anywhere on a scale of -- well I guess I learned a little bit there in the half I got to type to.. man that was a nightmare, maybe I can go home and figure this out by myself.

- There is so little time to work on individual assignments and way too much dealing with interpersonal dynamics.

- Politics.

- The readings..yet again.

- The portfolio. The expectation of essentially doing the assignments two times, once at least with a framework to work with, and once without, is creating too much of a time demand that I absolutely can not contend with.

- A couple days there wasn't much for direction on how to complete the tasks. It would be nice to have more of a demo to follow along with so when it comes to the lab we have a better understanding of what to do.

- everything

- lectures, reading assignments, the fact that I receive no feed back on my code what so ever.

- Code Review - partners, presentation dynamics, gender equality issues, sexism in tech The portfolio - poor feedback from TA's, confusing instructions, not enough time with labs.

- lecture student input pair programming

## WHICH ASPECTS OF THE COURSE DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

- Instructor lectures

- The most helpful was lecture and code review. I really enjoyed going over all the code we did the day before in class because it gave the solution to the previous day and I could reflect on any problems I had with the lab or my own portfolio assignment.

- Peer code reviews

- At this point, I don't know....trying to catch up.

- The Labs, as usual are awesome.

- The labs are great. I love pair programming and almost always get a lot out of it.

- The handlebars code demo was really helpful because it was hands-on. The ability to code along during lecture helped me better process what we were learning and also apply it later in our lab.

- Going through the lab assignments step by step and discussing the TODOs and ways of solving them.

- Lab work with partners is nice.

- we were introduced to lots of cool tools. jQuery, Handlebars, RWD now I just need to find time to actually learn them. Maybe a code school... oh wait that is where I am going.

- Labs.

- Pair programming and code review.

- The TA's were exceptional. I feel like there is nothing more I could expect of them except more conversation about the portfolios and more feedback in a timely manner.

- Working with classmates during the labs has been great. It's nice to collaborate in a group to get more heads involved in solving problems.

- nothing

- google, its teaching 90% of what I am learning.

- Code Review - great way to learn, especially if we can get more class members to ask / answer questions and the conversation can be well developed by the professor.

- Time coding at my keyboard looking up docs and getting help from TA's.

## DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

- Keep trucking!

- Not at this time.

- No :)

- I am concerned about not understanding everything. It is the first time that I feel very stressed.

- Sometimes the push to talk about diversity, equal opportunity, etc. can be excessive...we're all adults and we didn't enroll to learn social studies or intro to psychology, stick to coding!!! Thats what I'm here for, and what I expect as a customer!

- Would be really nice if we had monitors for pair work, and if lights were more appropriate for office environment.

- I wish basic training on how to work in small groups (lab work in pairs) could be included in the curriculum: readings, class discussions, better written guidelines.

- We seem to get pulled off in random tangents during class discussions. I much prefer the doing aspect.

- I would love to see a set deadline for pair-programming. Maybe two hours and you turn it in, regardless if it is done or not.

- I would like to spend more time studying the days code and working on my personal assignments but feel pressure to get the pair-programming completely done before switching tasks. I don't feel like I learn well in a pair and am frustrated so much time is dedicated to it.

- Less reading more coding. Instead of reading homework, give us an assignment to do instead.

- Yes, I feel like the grading of the portfolio requires us to rush through when we're left with little time remaining from the daily pair programming assignments. If it were either a) ungraded or b) only issued a final grade, I feel like it would be a lot easier to build it incrementally. To even develop an idea of what you want to DO with your portfolio is time consuming, let alone implementing new coding concepts without a code base as in the assignments.

- I'd much prefer 201 learning style: creating something rather than code snippets. I understand this what real world does but here I'm trying to practice on a concept I just learnt for an hour.

- I'm so lost that I couldn't even understand what the TODO is asking for on Friday's pair-programming assignment. And then one of the codes needs to write with javaScript conditional ternary statement which I've never even known it exist.

- I don't think I'm learning or grasping the concepts in this pace, perhaps there can be some fine-tuning of balancing real-world and learning environments.

- I feel like I am not getting my bang for my buck.... it seems like I could pay $25 for Treehouse and get the same education. In class I am given a very general concept and then I have to go google how to implement everything. Which would be fine if the class cost $25 but people are paying good money to come to your establishment and learn code. Not how to use google. If the classes were structured more towards hands on learning and not so much lecture I think it would be much more beneficial.

- Checkins that have the same number of people in each group as to finish on time.

- Appointed facilitators (each day a different student in each group is responsible for asking the questions)

- Teacher / TA supervision of conversations

- Gender and vet ratio evened out over groups

- Is this a coding boot camp or an educational institution on he dinosaur farm? We are paying boot camp prices. We are here to learn hard coding skills and become stand alone developers.
