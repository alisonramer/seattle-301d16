# Code 301, Class 6: ***AJAX & JSON***

*Here we go! Onwards, into Week 2 and a study of the Model layer. Asynchronous connections... and standardized data formats? This all sounds like a serious upgrade to our application logic! Let's see what you can do with the blog app (and your portfolios!) once we apply these concepts!*

*This week, you will construct a model layer in your application that accesses and transforms persisted client-side data, conforming to common WRRC, FP, and CRUD conventions.*
